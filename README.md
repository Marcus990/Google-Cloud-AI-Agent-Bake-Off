As a user of Cymbal Bank's financial services platform, you should have full control of your money. You should have full confidence in our platform's reliability while still having a great user experience with ease-of-use. 

We present the Cymbal Bank Orchestra Platform, an intelligent financial services platform built with Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK), A2A Protocol, and Gemini models. This multi-agent system provides comprehensive banking assistance through specialized AI agents for daily spending, investments, financial planning, and more. The user has full control over the agents (instruments) that interact with their bank account as the composer of their orchestra.

## 🎯 Overview

This project is a demonstration of agentic AI architecture for financial services, featuring:

- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Specialized AI agents working together to handle complex financial tasks
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket-based streaming interface with text and audio support
- **Comprehensive Banking Features**: Account management, transaction tracking, goal setting, calendar scheduling, and financial insights
- **Modern UI**: React-based frontend with real-time updates and interactive visualizations

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Backend (`backend/no-name-agent/`)

The backend is built with Python and FastAPI, featuring a hierarchical agent system:

#### Core Agents

- **Root Agent**: Main orchestrator that routes requests to specialized sub-agents
- **Financial Agent**: Handles core banking operations (accounts, transactions, goals, schedules)
- **Daily Spendings Agent**: Manages subscriptions, discounts, and duplicate charge detection
- **Big Spendings Agent**: Analyzes affordability for large purchases and mortgage eligibility
- **Investments Agent**: Provides market data, investment concepts, and financial news
- **Calendar Agent**: Manages appointments with bank advisors
- **Transaction History Agent**: Specialized agent for retrieving user transaction data
- **Proactive Insights Agent**: Generates personalized financial insights and recommendations

### Frontend (`frontend/`)

Modern React application built with TypeScript and Vite:

- **Real-time Chat Interface**: WebSocket-based communication with streaming responses
- **Audio Support**: Speech-to-text and text-to-speech capabilities
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Transaction history charts and financial insights
- **Permission System**: User-controlled data access and agent capabilities
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface with modern UI components

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.9+**
- **Node.js 16+**
- **Google Cloud Account** with Gemini API access
- **Google Calendar API credentials** (optional, for calendar features)

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend/no-name-agent
   ```

2. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   # Create a .env file with your API keys
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
   ```

4. (Optional) Set up Google Calendar authentication:
   ```bash
   python setup_calendar_auth.py
   ```

5. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   ./start.sh
   ```

   The backend will be available at `http://localhost:8001`

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   ./start.sh
   # or
   npm run dev
   ```

   The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173`
